## Overview

### Description

The RecipeBook app allows users to choose their recipes and/or meals, and tailors the grocery list accordingly. Users are also allowed to personalize their recipes according to their lifestyle (Paleo, Gluten Free, Weight Loss, Kid Friendly, Vegetarian, Vegan, Low Carb, Low Fat, Prediabetic, and more)

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** Website is view only, uses recipes with real-time review, and comment section
- **Story:** Allows users to choose recipes, create a weekly meal plan, and give a list-amount of groceries needed
- **Market:** Custom meal plans, personalized recipes and grocery lists to help users save time and eat better
- **Habit:** Users can choose the type of diet, or cuisine they would like to have for a meal plan. The digital pantry takes into account what users have in their kitchen to reduce food waste and save money.
- **Scope:** The stripped-down version of the app has a list of recipes that could save both cooking and preparation time, and takes into account the list of ingredients needed per meal (plan, if possible).
